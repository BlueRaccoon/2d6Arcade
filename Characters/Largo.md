>  • To focus on multiple effects, when adding a new effect  you must succeed a `♦Will` Save against the number of effects already held  
>  • When Injured or Disrupted, you must succeed a `♥Will` Save (T1+number of Effects) or lose your Focus  
>   • Focusing on an effect for hours at a time may require a ♥♦Will Save to avoid taking Strain (GM Discretion based on circumstance)
